## 🎯 Demo Narrative (6 Minutes)

| Minute | What | Why | Impact |
|--------|------|-----|--------|
| 0-1 | Show system ONLINE | Establish baseline | Investors see stability |
| 1-2 | Disconnect WiFi | Show independence | No cloud required |
| 2-4 | Run outbreak simulation | Create urgency | Data shows crisis |
| 4-5 | Refresh dashboard | Reveal intelligence | Metrics go RED, automatic |
| 5-6 | Show legal enforcement | Prove sovereignty | Law is code, offline |

**Closing Line:**
> "The internet is dead. The cloud is gone. But the sovereign intelligence is still protecting the camp. This is how you save lives without surveillance. This is dignity at scale."

## ✨ What Makes This Demo Compelling

### ✅ It's LIVE
- Not a video, screenshot, or mockup
- Actual code executing right now
- Investors watch it happen in real-time

### ✅ It's OFFLINE
- WiFi demonstrably off
- System provably working without internet
- Proves edge-first architecture

### ✅ It's DRAMATIC
- Metrics shift from GREEN to RED visibly
- Z-score rises exponentially
- Bond payout triggered automatically
- Security enforcement blocks illegal exports

### ✅ It's EXPLAINABLE
- Data fusion shown (CBS + EMR = Truth)
- Timeline is clear (12h signals → 24h confirmation)
- Legal enforcement visible (code blocks action)
- No magic, just software

### ✅ It's REPEATABLE
- Same demo every time
- Works on any laptop with Python
- No special hardware or network needed
- 6 minutes from start to finish

## 🛡️ Governance Enforcement Demonstration

### The Setup
```bash
python -c "
from governance_kernel.vector_ledger import SovereignGuardrail, SovereigntyViolationError

guard = SovereignGuardrail()

# Try to violate GDPR during WiFi blackout
try:
    guard.validate_action(
        action_type='Data_Transfer',
        payload={
            'data_type': 'PHI',
            'destination': 'Foreign_Cloud',
            'patient_count': 11776
        },
        jurisdiction='GDPR_EU'
    )
except SovereigntyViolationError as e:
    print(e)
"
```

### The Output
```
❌ SOVEREIGNTY VIOLATION: Protected health data cannot be transferred 
to foreign cloud infrastructure.
   Data Type: PHI
   Destination: Foreign_Cloud
   Legal Citation: GDPR Art. 9 (Processing of special categories), 
                   Kenya DPA §37 (Transfer Restrictions), 
                   HIPAA §164.312(a)(2)(ii) (Encryption in Transit)
```

### The Message to Investors
> "Even if the internet came back right now, this system would refuse to export the data to a foreign cloud. This isn't a setting you toggle on/off. It's the law, written in code. Kenya's law. Europe's law. Respected offline."

## 🗺️ Geographic Context

### Dadaab Refugee Complex
- **Location:** Kenya, ~500km northeast of Nairobi
- **Population:** ~330,000 (3 camps + admin area)
- **Infrastructure:** Minimal, unreliable internet
- **Health:** Cholera-endemic region, recurring outbreaks
- **Governance:** Kenyan law (KDPA), humanitarian oversight

### Zones Simulated
1. **Ifo Camp** (125,000) — 247 cases (0.20% attack rate)
2. **Hagadera Camp** (89,000) — 312 cases (0.35% attack rate)
3. **Dagahaley Camp** (79,000) — 189 cases (0.24% attack rate)
4. **Kambios** (35,000) — 173 cases (0.49% attack rate, highest)

## 💰 The Parametric Bond Payout

### Trigger Mechanism
```
IF Z-Score > 2.576  (99% confidence threshold)
  THEN Bond Status = PAYOUT_RELEASED
  THEN Insurance payout flows automatically
  THEN No bureaucracy, no delay
```

### Demo Values
- **Threshold:** Z = 2.576
- **Achieved:** Z = 10.3 (4x trigger)
- **Status:** PAYOUT_RELEASED 🔴
- **Narrative:** "Insurance decided in milliseconds. No waiting for government reports."

## 🚀 Investor Talking Points

**When they see the green dashboard:**
> "This node is protecting 330,000 people. Right now. Offline. No cloud required."

**When WiFi turns off:**
> "The internet is gone. Watch. The system is still online."

**When metrics spike:**
> "Z-score 10.3. That's detection in real time. Insurance payout automatic. Lives saved."

**When showing the legal block:**
> "Kenya owns Kenya's data. This code respects that. Always. Even offline."

**Closing:**
> "This isn't a SaaS product. This is a public health weapon. Designed for places where the internet isn't reliable, but dignity is non-negotiable."
