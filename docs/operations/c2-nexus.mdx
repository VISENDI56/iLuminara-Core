The C2 Nexus is the operational heart of iLuminara. It provides a "Single Pane of Glass" view of the entire Sovereign Grid.

### Live Simulation
The dashboard connects to the LiveDataHarness, visualizing real-time intercepts:
* 🔴 Blocked: Supply chain items from conflict zones (UFLPA).
* 🔴 Frozen: Financial transfers to sanctioned entities (OFAC).
* 🟢 Approved: Targeted aid to high-risk districts (Sanitation).
