# System 2 Architectural Vision

Emulating Blitzy principles for sovereign health AI...

## Trade-Off Visualization
Trades inference latency for expandable context—reasoning across planetary-scale health nexus.

## Quality vs. Cost Metrics
Higher inference costs yield pre-validated, humanitarian-constrained outputs—zero regressions via autonomous loops.

## Performance Proof
Emulates 86.8% Pass@1 via multi-agent validation—autonomous agents achieve verified sovereignty on biosecurity tasks.

## Infrastructure Summaries
Domain-Specific Context: Hierarchical relational graph of governance_kernel + edge_node + 47-framework matrix.
