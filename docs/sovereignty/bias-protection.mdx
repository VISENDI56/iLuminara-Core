iLuminara implements bias detection and mitigation at every stage of automated decision-making.

- **Detection**: Statistical analysis of outcomes for disparate impact
- **Mitigation**: Algorithmic adjustments and human-in-the-loop review
- **Transparency**: All decisions are logged and explainable

This protects vulnerable populations and ensures compliance with global fairness standards.
