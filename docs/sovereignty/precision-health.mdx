Based on Research File A ("Targeted Sanitation"), iLuminara implements Hyper-Local Resource Allocation.

### The Risk Heatmap
Instead of distributing aid randomly, the TargetedSanitationAgent fuses data streams:
* Water Sensors: Real-time coliform counts.
* Clinical Data: Live hospital admission rates for dysentery.

#### Logic Gate
The system contains a hardcoded financial trigger:

```python
if composite_risk > 0.85:
    return "DISPATCH_SANITATION_KITS_IMMEDIATELY"
```

This ensures resources only go where the data proves they are needed, maximizing the impact of every dollar.
