2. **Context Distiller:** The teacher. Shrinks massive safety manuals into tiny edge models.

## ⚖️ Governance & Law
3. **Omni-Law Matrix:** The conscience. Blocks actions that violate the Geneva Convention.
4. **Z3 Formal Gate:** The judge. Mathematically proves safety before action.
5. **HSML Protocol:** The record. Logs every decision in a universal humanitarian format.

## 🛡️ Security & Resilience
6. **Sovereign Bio-Lock:** The identity. Fuses code with the Director's biometrics and CR12.
7. **Ghost-Mesh Fabric:** The nerves. Keeps the system talking even when the internet dies.
8. **Safety Island Bridge:** The shield. A physical hardware switch that cuts power to unsafe drones.

## 🧬 Biology & Data
9. **BioNeMo SaMD:** The hands. Designs cures with medical-grade safety checks.
10. **PABS Federated Net:** The vault. Ensures data stays in the country while learning globally.

## 💰 Economics
