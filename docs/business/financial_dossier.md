# Quantitative Business Model

## 1. Valuation Simulation (Monte Carlo)
Instead of a static number, we model iLuminara as a probability distribution.

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mean (Expected) Valuation** | **$3.82 Million** |
| **Median Valuation** | $3.65 Million |
| **10th Percentile (Pessimistic)** | $2.11 Million |
| **90th Percentile (Optimistic)** | **$5.95 Million** |

**Strategic Takeaway:** Our "Nuclear IP Stack" provides a massive upside tail ($6M valuation) if the technology de-risks the long government sales cycles.

## 2. 5-Year Integrated Projections ($000s)
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Deals** | 1 (Pilot) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| **ARR** | $250 | $1,750 | $5,500 | $12,000 | $22,500 |
| **Gross Profit (80%)** | $200 | $1,400 | $4,400 | $9,600 | $18,000 |
| **EBITDA** | ($1,400) | ($1,700) | ($400) | $3,200 | $10,000 |
| **Cumulative Burn** | ($1,400) | ($3,100) | ($3,500) | ($300) | $9,700 |

**Peak Cash Need:** ~$3.5 Million (Series A target).

## 3. Unit Economics: The B2G "Sovereign Node"
* **ACV:** $1,000,000 (Tier 2 National Ministry).
* **CAC:** $1,500,000 (18-month sales cycle).
* **CTS (Cost to Serve):** $200,000 (Cloud, Support, Maintenance).
* **LTV (5 Years):** $4,250,000.
* **LTV:CAC:** **2.8x** (Base) -> **6.5x** (Post-Optimization).

## 4. Sensitivity Analysis (The Viability Levers)
* **Increasing ACV:** Adding the "Autonomous Logistics" module increases LTV by $1.0M.
* **Reducing CAC:** Shortening sales cycles to 12 months via technical reputation reduces CAC by 30%.
