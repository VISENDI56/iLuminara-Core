# Operational Readiness Report: Project iLuminara
**Reference:** Build-Rev 181 to 216  
**Status:** SOVEREIGN-DEPLOYMENT READY  
**Custodian:** [The Director]  
**Hardware Root:** Blackwell Cluster B300-Nairobi

## I. Executive Summary
iLuminara has successfully transitioned to a **Sovereign Autonomous Substrate**. This verifies that clinical intelligence is physically and biologically tethered to the local Nairobi environment.

## II. The Sovereign Trinity Audit
1. **Logic & Safety (Z3-Gate):** Mathematically proven diagnostic outputs.
2. **Physical Security (Nuclear IP):** - **IP-01 (Aegis):** Silicon-rooted identity.
   - **IP-02 (Shredder):** NIST 800-88 compliant 7-pass overwrite.
   - **IP-03 (Acorn):** Somatic biometric unlocking.
3. **Network Resilience (Phantom-Link):** LPI/LPD protocols disguising data as meteorological noise.

## III. The "Lazarus" Protocol: Digital Immortality
As of Rev 215, the system state is compressed into a **4KB Genetic Seed**, allowing regrowth from any total disk wipe provided IP-01 is intact.

## IV. Final Verdict
The Genesis Key (Rev 216) is derived on-the-fly. Without the Director's physical presence, the clinical logic remains in a "Void-State."
