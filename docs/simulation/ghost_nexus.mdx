# Ghost-Nexus Engine

The **Ghost-Nexus** is iLuminara's chaotic attractor simulator. It validates the **JEPA/MPC Architecture** by flooding the system with:

1.  **Biological Load:** High-throughput pathogen sequencing requests.
2.  **Kinetic Load:** Emergency drone routing conflicts.
3.  **Network Load:** Spectrum jamming simulation.

## Usage
```bash
make stress-test
```

## Success Criteria
The system passes if the **Energy-Based MPC** maintains stability (does not collapse into high-energy risk states) throughout the 10-second chaos window.
