## Integrated Management System Kernel

The IMS Kernel provides unified control mapping across ISO 42001 (AI), 27001 (Security), and 27701 (Privacy) standards.

### Core Components

- **IMSOrchestrator**: Central orchestration for triple-certification
- **UnifiedControl**: Single controls satisfying multiple standards
- **ControlCategory**: Hierarchical control classification

### Key Methods

- `auto_generate_soa()`: Automated Statement of Applicability generation
- `continuous_certification_monitor()`: Real-time compliance monitoring

### Implementation

```python
from governance.ims_kernel import IMSOrchestrator

orchestrator = IMSOrchestrator()
soa = orchestrator.auto_generate_soa()
status = orchestrator.continuous_certification_monitor()
```
