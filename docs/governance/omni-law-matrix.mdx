description: 'Automated Enforcement of 47 Global Frameworks.'
---

The **Governance Kernel** implements a Sectoral Abstraction Layer that automatically enforces 47 distinct legal frameworks based on transaction context.

## The Core 18 (Privacy & Security)
These frameworks are enforced on *every* transaction (The Bedrock).
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="GDPR & EU Privacy">
      Enforces Article 9 (Health Data) and Article 22 (Automated Decision Review).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="HIPAA & HITECH">
      Enforces audit trails (`blockchain_logger.py`) and 60-day breach notification clocks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sovereignty (KDPA/POPIA/NDPR)">
      Enforces Data Residency (e.g., "Data collected in Kenya stays in Kenya").
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Sectoral 29 (Expansion Pack)
These are context-specific triggers managed by `sectoral_laws.json`.

| Context | Frameworks | Trigger Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
