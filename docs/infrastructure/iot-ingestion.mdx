## IoT Ingestion Gateway

Handles real-time telemetry from LoRaWAN and MQTT sensors for public health monitoring.

### Components

- **HealthIoTGateway**: MQTT message handler
- Sensor data routing
- Real-time public health alerts

### Supported Sensors

- Water quality (coliform detection)
- Medical cold chain monitoring
- Environmental health indicators

### Implementation

```python
from infrastructure.iot_ingestion.mqtt_handler import HealthIoTGateway

gateway = HealthIoTGateway()
gateway.on_message_received("sensors/district_9/water", '{"type": "coliform", "value": 450}')
```
