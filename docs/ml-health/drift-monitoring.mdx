## AI Model Drift Monitor

Real-time monitoring of AI prediction accuracy and fairness metrics.

### Components

- **ModelDriftMonitor**: Drift detection engine
- NIST Trustworthiness integration
- Automated retraining triggers

### Features

- MSE-based drift calculation
- Fairness monitoring
- Automatic model updates

### Integration

Feeds into NIST measurement engine for overall trustworthiness scoring.

```python
from infrastructure.observability.drift_monitor import ModelDriftMonitor

monitor = ModelDriftMonitor()
status = monitor.check_drift(predictions, actuals)
```
