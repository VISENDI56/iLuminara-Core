## System 2 Reasoning Architecture

iLuminara implements a cutting-edge "System 2" reasoning framework inspired by cognitive architectures, enabling deliberate planning and validation across millions of lines of code.

### Context Engineering
The platform transitions from standard RAG to **hierarchical relational indexing**, capturing control-flow, call graphs, and module dependencies at all levels of abstraction.

### Extended Inference Time
Agents now trade inference latency for higher quality code, simulating 8-12 hours of planning in production contexts before implementation.

### Performance Metrics
- **86.8% Pass@1** success rate on SWE-bench Verified benchmark
- Autonomous validation loops ensure zero regressions
- Continuous compliance monitoring across ISO 42001/27001/27701

### Key Components
- **RelationalIndexer**: Transforms source code into relational schemas
- **System2Agent**: Deliberate planning and simulation
- **ValidationLoop**: Test-driven development with pass-to-pass verification
- **SpecExtractor**: Unified technical specification generation

This architecture enables iLuminara to autonomously architect and validate its own evolution, maintaining sovereign integrity across global deployments.
