The Semantic Graph is the backbone of iLuminara's data intelligence. It unifies all entities, relationships, and compliance triggers into a single, queryable model.

- **Entities**: People, organizations, assets, transactions
- **Relationships**: Ownership, control, risk, compliance
- **Triggers**: Automated detection of compliance events

This model powers the reasoning engine and enables real-time, context-aware enforcement across all 47 frameworks.
