iLuminara moves beyond "System 1" (Reflexive AI) to "System 2" (Deliberate AI).

## The Reasoning Loop
Every Security and Health Agent follows this strict protocol:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Planning (CoT)">
      The agent analyzes the threat and drafts a remediation specification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulation (Causal Twin)">
      The agent spins up a sandbox to test the fix. **Crucial:** It checks for downstream breakages (e.g., "Does blocking this IP kill the Payroll Server?").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
      If the simulation passes with >99% confidence, the action is approved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
      The `SovereignGuardrail` allows the write-action to the live database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```python
# The Core Loop (agents/security_operations/system2_soc.py)
plan = self._reason_through_strategy(incident_context)
sim_result = self._simulate_remediation(plan)
if sim_result["outcome"] == "SUCCESS":
    self._execute_fix(plan)
```
