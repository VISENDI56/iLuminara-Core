# iLuminara-Core: Governance & Ethical AI Framework

## ⚖️ Policy Anchors
iLuminara-Core is not a black-box system. Every decision is anchored to:
- **International Law**: 1951 Refugee Convention (Non-refoulement protection).
- **National Law**: Kenya Data Protection Act 2019 (Sovereignty & Residency).
- **Standards**: ISO 42001 (AI Management System) & NIST AI RMF.

## 🛡️ Data Sovereignty (Phase 5.2)
The architecture utilizes a "Sovereign Moat." No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leaves the designated deployment region.
- **Local Persistence**: SQLite-based local storage.
- **Hardened Logs**: ISO-compliant forensic trail in `logs/`.

## 🤖 Algorithmic Accountability
Every inference generated by the Blackwell B300 compute layer is passed through the **Governance Kernel** to ensure "Human-in-the-loop" verification before any resource (drones/clinics) is deployed.
