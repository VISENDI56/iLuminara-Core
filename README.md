# iLuminara-Core: The Sovereign Health OS

**Status:** Enterprise / Nuclear IP Stack (Live)
**Architecture:** JEPA-MPC (Energy-Based)
**Compliance:** ISO 42001 / IEC 62304

## The Mission
To solve the **"Last Mile of Humanity"** problem by deploying a self-sovereign AI operating system for refugee settlements. iLuminara replaces dependence with capability, converting camps into "Smart Cities" powered by Generative Biology and Autonomous Logistics.

## The Nuclear IP Stack (2025)
1.  **Biological Apex:** NVIDIA BioNeMo Evo 2 (Generative Design).
2.  **Kinetic Nervous System:** Holoscan 25h1 + cuOpt (Agentic Logistics).
3.  **Spatial Omniscience:** ESRI Native SDK (Offline GeoGhost).
4.  **Constitutional Governance:** Omni-Law Matrix (47 Frameworks).
5.  **Cognitive Core:** Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) + JEPA Architecture.

## Quick Start (Engineering)
```bash
# 1. Setup Environment
make setup

# 2. Run Ghost-Nexus Stress Test (Chaos Sim)
make stress-test

# 3. Launch Enterprise Command Center
make run
```

## Architecture Highlights
* **Pixel-First Input:** \`RetinaInputLayer\` bypasses fragile text tokenizers.
* **XAI Engine:** \`GradientSaliency\` provides clinical explainability.
* **Federated Locks:** \`SecureAggregator\` ensures mathematical sovereignty.
* **Hybrid Cloud:** \`Nebius Bridge\` for burst compute and distillation.
